# My "New Series" Daleks

One of the most intriguing (for me at least) characters of the BBC series 'Doctor Who' is the Dalek. 
Their first appearence in the series was in the 1963 Doctor Who episode 'The Daleks', (also known as 'The Mutants and The Dead Planet'.<br />
Since their first appearance there have been a number of variations of the Daleks. In the sixth episode of the 'new series' (started in march 2005) a completely redesigned lone Dalek appeared. <br />
This design is known as the New Series Dalek and I just had to have one. :wink:

## The build

Before you start reading and maybe even using my code a small advance warning:<br />
**This build is overly and unnecessary complex, and I did this on purpose**<br />

There are three main reasons for this complexity:
1. During pre-build tests I ran into problems with the not-so multithreading behaviour of the good old arduino.
2. I happened to have a box with a number of different Arduinos laying arround.
3. I wanted to get some experience with I2C communication between microcontrollers.

## The Dalek body

The Actual Dalek is build from plan I purchased on the project dalek forum. These are realy detailed and made building anlot easier for me.
I started with the skirt. I made the pannels from plywood and glued them together.

After a trip to the "Action" to get some pingpong balls and some paint at the hardware the skirt looks like this:

</p>

In the sametime I was building the skirt I was finishing the build of a new 3D printer with a build volume of40x40x40 cm. 
So I decided to print the rest of the Dalek.<br />
One of the Prohject Dalek forum moderators, Audry2 created a scale Renegade Dalek kit wich can be downloaded from the forum.
I found an other more detailed version from the same author on thingiverse [thing 369866](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:369866).<br />
I used this version to print the rest of my Dalek.<br />
After some test prints I found that if I resized the parts 385% they where at the same scale as the skirt I build. <br />
Knowing that I started printing, sanding, painting and glueing it all together.

The complete result is the Dalek shown at the top of this readme.

This Dalek would never have been build without the help of all the great guys at the [Dalek Forum](https://www.projectdalek.com/) and the plans and schematics they have produced there.
