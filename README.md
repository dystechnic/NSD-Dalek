# My "New Series" Daleks

One of the most intriguing (for me at least) characters of the BBC series 'Doctor Who' is the Dalek. 
Their first appearence in the series was in the 1963 Doctor Who episode 'The Daleks', (also known as 'The Mutants and The Dead Planet'.<br />
Since their first appearance there have been a number of variations of the Daleks. In the sixth episode of the 'new series' (started in march 2005) a completely redesigned lone Dalek appeared. <br />
This design is known as the New Series Dalek and I just had to have one. :wink:

This Dalek would never have been build without the help of all the great guys at the [Dalek Forum](https://www.projectdalek.com/) and the plans and schematics they have produced there.
